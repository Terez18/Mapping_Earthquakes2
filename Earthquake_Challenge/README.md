# Mapping_Earthquakes2
Interactive Earthquakes Map

This challenge included adding visual data to a map. Three different types of maps can be used: streets, satellite and light options. On top of the map there are three layers that can each be toggled on or off: a layer of earthquakes in the past 7 days data taken from the USGS website, a layer of major earthquakes of 4.5 or more and the third layer of tectonic plates. The earthquake data is presented in a way that emphasizes the size of the earthquake using color, red for larger and yellow for smaller earthquakes as well as the size of the circle reflects the magnitude of the earthquake.

javascript d3 is used to create the visualizations and Leaflet is used for working with maps. html is used to present the maps online.
